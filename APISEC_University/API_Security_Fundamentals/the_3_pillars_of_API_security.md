* **Governance** = Is about defining, establishing and enforcing the processes of developing APIs, testing APIs, and getting them into production in a consistent and secure way.
* **Testing** = is about ensuring that your APIs perform as expected and are free of vulnerabilities or other flaws that can be exploited.
* **Monitoring** = Is about runtime monitoring of those APIs to make sure they're behaving as expected, there arenâ€™t attacks in process that are succeeding or other anomalous behavior on your APIs.
