* **Governance** = Is about defining, establishing and enforcing the processes of developing APIs, testing APIs, and getting them into production in a consistent and secure way.
* **Testing** = is about ensuring that your APIs perform as expected and are free of vulnerabilities or other flaws that can be exploited.
* **Monitoring** = Is about runtime monitoring of those APIs to make sure they're behaving as expected, there arenâ€™t attacks in process that are succeeding or other anomalous behavior on your APIs.

### Awareness

#### Know Your APIs

* **Get full inventory APIs:**
  * Purpose, owner, documentation
  * What functionality do they offer?
  * Where are they?
  * What is the infrastructure?
  * What is the app architecture?
  * Which containers and virtual machines are related to the API?
  * The databases being connected to the network infrastructure.

* **Standardize and enforce API deployment process:**
   * Only get deployed in approved ways with proper validation according to the context
   * Nothing gets out there without following the process
   * Existence of "shadow/rogue" APIs sign of weak governance
   * Enforce governance at Gateway, Marketplace

* **Mandate API Documentation:**
  * Even with your third party clients and Partners
  * Is critical for testing and validation in Security
  * Make sure APIs are consistent and reusable

* **Create API Development standards:**
  * Create Design Guides for API development so that these APIs get developed
  * Style guides
  * Authentication requirements
  * Versioning
  * PII (Personally Identifiable Information) tracking.

#### Know Your Risks (Threat Modeling)

* **Understand the nature of your APIs (Identify):**
  * What are they?
  * What business flows do they power?
  * What data do they have access to?
  * Who has access to it?
  * Roles and access controls

* **Assess your risk:**
  * What potential threats?
  * What vulnerabilities exist?
  * What logic flaws?
  * What access third parties have?

* **Probability of attack:**
  * Is this data highly sensitive and highly valuable, or is it fairly benign and low value to an attack?
    * **That will help you with your priorization and understanding the impact:**
      * What's the nature of an exploit?
      * What damage?
      * What kind of loss?
      * What consequence can result?

* **Define a response plan (Mitigation):**
  * How are you going to response to an attack when it happens?
  * And how will you address those risks?

#### Documentation: OpenAPI Specification (AKA Swagger)

</p>

* It doesn't only help integration and enable use of you APIs, but it also aids in security;
* Testing can be built around your API documentation;
* Runtime monitoring can e aided with this documentation;
* You know what you're publishing publicly;
* Make sure you're only publishing what deserves to be out there and that you're retiring old documentation;
* The documentation itself will define everything about your API:
  * The functionality of the endpoints
  * The description
  * Where the API exists
  * The base url
  * All the endpoints
  * The payloads
  * Authentication requirements
  * The input parameters and data types
  * What methods are supported

#### Design Guides: Promote Governance, Consistency

* **Authentication:**
  * How you will authenticate users?
  * What type of authentication?
  * Where you use different types of authentication?

* **Authorization:** 
  * How you controle who has access to what?
    * Where you will enforce that?

* **Naming Conventions:**
   * Tipically you want your URLs to be nouns and Methods to be verbs
   * Whether you're Posting a new record or Putting a new value in or Deleting thing;

* **Error codes:**
  * Should includes status code
  * reference IDs and human readable messages, but make sure those messages aren't revealing useful information back to a potential attacker
    * Don't put in the message what type of data you are expecting 0 Tha's simply informing an attacker how to attack your API

* **Versioning:**
  * When to increment? And when not to

* **Units, Formts, Standards:**
  * Date/time formats, timezone, locales
